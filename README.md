# Yahtzee-Analysis
In this Repo, I analyze and visualize Yahtzee Data from Freethedice.com.

My goal is to eventually create a AI bot that plays Yahtzee better than the average human.

I will document my work in various Jupyter notebooks that are located in the Documentation folder (located in the 'View Code' tab if you are on mobile).

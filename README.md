# Yahtzee-Analysis
In this Repo, I analyze and visualize Yahtzee Data from Freethedice.com.
My goal is to eventually create a AI bot that plays Yahtzee better than the average human.

I will document my work in various Jupyter notebooks that are located in the Documentation folder.  
If you are on mobile, the documentation is located in the 'View Code' tab. Also, the Documents will not load by default. You will have to scroll to the bottom of the page and select 'Desktop Version' for the file to load.
